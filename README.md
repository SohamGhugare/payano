# Payano

Payano is a decentralized application (dApp) built for the Cardano Berlin Hackathon by NMKR. It enables users to shop online and pay later by locking their ADA as collateralâ€”without selling it. The platform provides instant approval, flexible repayment terms, and ensures users can keep their ADA stacking while accessing liquidity.

## What is Payano?
Payano leverages Cardano's smart contract capabilities to create a trustless, automated lending experience. Users can:
- Lock ADA as collateral to receive instant loans for online shopping.
- Repay loans before a deadline to reclaim their collateral.
- Allow lenders to liquidate collateral if the loan is not repaid in time.

This system is designed to be secure, transparent, and user-friendly, making decentralized finance accessible for everyday purchases.

## Smart Contracts
All smart contracts for Payano are written in [Aiken](https://aiken-lang.org). You can find the contract source code in the [`contracts/`](./contracts) folder.
